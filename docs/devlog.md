# Devlog

Surprises and measurements, newest first. Raw material for the case study.

## Week 1, day 1 (Mon 5 Oct 2026)

- Tagged `v1-final` at `abc2a08`, branched `v2`, moved v1 into `legacy/v1/` (still runnable with its own Compose file).
- Offline virtual-clock run of the v1 simulator and rules (details in `docs/audit/v1-baseline.md`):
  - 108,683 alerts in 12 simulated hours from 3 trucks; a single compressor incident emits 120 alerts per minute.
  - `COMPRESSOR_FAULT` triggered 31,953 times but was published 17 times, masked by `TEMP_BREACH`.
  - The most frequent alert, `TIRE_PRESSURE_LOW`, is a simulator artifact: tire pressure is a random walk with no mean reversion.
- Local toolchain: Windows Defender quarantined `uv.exe` at first, and the Python 3.11 and 3.14 installs had lost their `python.exe`. The uv-managed CPython 3.12 still worked. `uv` was restored later the same day.
- ruff 0.16 formats Python code blocks inside Markdown, so the vendored skills under `.claude/` are excluded from ruff.
- The gitleaks pre-commit hook scans only staged changes. Run with `--all-files` in CI, it checks nothing. CI runs the gitleaks container over the full history instead.
- Not yet added to pre-commit: hadolint and sqlfluff, which arrive with the first Dockerfile and migration (day 4).
- Skeleton CI: lint, typecheck, test and secrets jobs. `make check` is green locally.
